In our text labeling app, we've adopted the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format as the input data structure. 
JSON provides a lightweight, readable, and flexible way to organize and exchange data. 
Each JSON file you input into our app adheres to this format, consisting of key-value pairs that encapsulate the information.

JSON files structure:

{
  "text": "your text .... "
}
