This user-friendly application is a Named Entity Recognition tool and empowers you to seamlessly add labels to text, providing a straightforward and efficient solution for categorizing and organizing your content. 
The annotator allows users to quickly assign custom labels to one or more entities in the text.
With a clean and intuitive interface, users can easily highlight and tag specific sections of text with customized labels, enhancing the clarity and structure of their textual data. 
Whether you're annotating for analysis, research, or personal organization, our app simplifies the labeling process, making it accessible to users of all levels. 
Elevate your text annotation experience with our app, streamlining the way you interact with and interpret textual information.

In our text labeling app, we've adopted the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format as the input data structure. 
JSON provides a lightweight, readable, and flexible way to organize and exchange data. 
Each JSON file you input into our app adheres to this format, consisting of key-value pairs that encapsulate the information.

JSON files structure:

{
  "text": "your text .... "
}
